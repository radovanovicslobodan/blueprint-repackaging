# java-cucumber-automation-template

## Introduction

java-cucumber-automation-template test automation framework will be used mostly for rest/graphql integration tests and UI E2E tests.

---
## Prerequisites
* gradle 7.3
* Open JDK 17
* Setup Allure on local machine if you want to generate report or install plugin for Jenkins
* IntelliJ IDEA - with lombok, cucumber plugins (set settings/gradle to Java 17)

## Dependencies
* For running tests - JUnit runner
* For BDD - cucumber(core, java, JVM, JUnit, gherkin), groovy-all
* For sending rest requests - rest-assured
* For serialization/deserialization body request/response - Gson, Jackson
* For UI - selenium and webdrivermanager
* Replacement getters and setter - Lombok
* Accessing yaml files - snake-yaml
* Logging - slf4j
* Reporting - allure (cucumber4-jvm, rest-assured), cukedoctor
* Javax mail, commons-email - for managing emails
* Awaitility - express expectations of an asynchronous system in a concise and easy to read manner
* Assertj-core - advance assertion methods
* Poiji - working with excel files
* Opencsv - working with csv files
* Postgresql - postgres database driver 

## Project structure:
* src/test/java/cucumber_blueprint/common - will be used for storing general helpers in common packages
* src/test/java/cucumber_blueprint/data_containers - will use for PicoContainer DI
* src/test/java/cucumber_blueprint/graphql - will be used for storing graphql steps, requests, responses and helpers
* src/test/java/cucumber_blueprint/rest - will be used for storing rest steps, requests, responses and helpers  
* src/test/java/rs/cucumber_blueprint/ui - will be used for storing selenium E2E tests
* src/test/resources -  will store features in the features package. Then feature package will have packages related to each functionality with specific features files. Also,  stores yaml for different environments (URL, credentials etcâ€¦) and graphql body files

## How to run tests:
* By Junit runner - just run class CucumberRunner in runners package. Default it will run tests on dev environment.
* By terminal type command:
  gradle cucumber -Denv={envName} -Ddriver={driverName} -Dcucumber.options="-t @tag1,@tag2 -t ~@igonredTag"

Note: envName is stored in properties.yml file.
If you have some tests that are currently failing because they are waiting future implementation, annotate them with @failing so we can ignore them during our run.

## Reporting:
* If you want to generate Allure report type in terminal: allure generate <yourPathToAllureReport/allure-results> --clear.
  After the task is finished check the allure-report package and open with the preferred browser open index.html file.
  (If you run as Junit run Class it allure-result will be generated in the root package if it is run via terminal/Gradle
  run it is stored in root/build/allure-result)
* Adoc file is generated at the end of run
